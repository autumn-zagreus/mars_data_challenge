A GitHub repository to hold the files for Module 12 Homework

Hello! Welcome to the ReadMe.
I am having an internal error at the moment and am not sure why. Will ask a TA for help soon.

Okay! So I asked for guidance and it turns out I had a few things wrong with my app.py file, and Dhinnara helped me solve them. They also told me
I need to make an index.html file for the code they helped me with to work, so I made one which helped me sort the data into a format which looks
like the example. From there I ran the app, took screenshots as required per the assignment page, and an extra screenshot to show that the "scrape
new data" button works.
